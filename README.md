##💥 Struggles & Learnings
🎯 Not Really Hard After Snake Game:
Once I built the Snake game, this Ping Pong game felt manageable.

🤯 The Tricky Part – Paddle Bounce:
The most challenging part was getting the ball to bounce correctly off the paddles. Sometimes it would pass right through or get stuck, which was frustrating.

💡 Key Learning:
Fixing that collision logic taught me a lot about angles, distances, and how turtle detects overlaps.

😄 Overall:
Making this was fun, exciting, and helped me understand real-time game mechanics better.
